# TB/NTM species identification pipeline Version 1.0 (beta)

# Short Description
The pipeline is constructed using nextflow as workflow manager running in a docker container.
It is able to identify species of TB/nTM from positive MGIT cultures.
To do so it uses a hsp65 database for fast identification coupled with
a Metagenomic method using centrifuge to identify on genome level.
For TB it also is able to identify subspecies.
Results are presented in automated pdf and html reports.
